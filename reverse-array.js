// With a for loop, create a JavaScript code that creates a new array in reverse order

// this is our function, we will need to put in the given inputs into out Arr array
// if we put const Arr = [1,2,3] => [3,2,1]
const Arr = [];

// create a loop that reverse given array
// since we are reversing, instead of i=0, we will let i=Array variable, and i would be greater than 0
for (let i=Arr.length -1; i >=0; i--) {

    // once console, should reverse the number
    console.log(Arr[i])
}

console.log("good work");
